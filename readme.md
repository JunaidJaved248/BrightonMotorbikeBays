Brighton and Hove City Council publish a list of all Motorbike Parking Bays in the City, but only by road name, not an exact GPS location. This is where this Laravel application comes in...

I will be adding the desired features as and when I get time. Please feel free to submit a pull request if anyone has any enhancements.

## Current features

- Shows accurate location of bike bay on Google Maps
- Street View image of bike bay, or image if one exists
- Different icon depending if the bay has secure locking points

Current application is availiable at the below URL
<a href="http://brightonbikebays.magenificent.com">brightonbikebays.magenificent.com</a>

<strong>Please Note: The database does not currently contain all bike bays in Brighton, this is being updated as and when I have the time.</strong>
