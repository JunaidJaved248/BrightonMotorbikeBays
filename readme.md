Brighton and Hove City Council publish a list of all Motobike Parking Bays in the City, but only by road name, not an exact GPS location. This is where this Laravel application comes in...

I will be adding the desired features as and when I get time. Please feel free to submit a pull request if anyone has any enhancements.

## Current features

- Shows accurate location of bike bay on Google Maps

## Desired features

- Show an image of the bike bay
- Display a lock icon to show if the bay has a bike lock

Current application is availiable at the below URL

<strong>Please Note: The database does not currently contain all bike bays in Brighton, this is being updated as and when I have the time.</strong>
